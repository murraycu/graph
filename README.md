# Boost Graph Library

A generic interface for traversing graphs, using C++ templates.

## Build from git

Clone the whole boost project, which includes the individual Boost projects as 
git submodules: https://github.com/boostorg/boost

Then run bootstap and b2. For instance, on Linux:

```
$ ./bootstrap
$ ./b2
```

See https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/wiki/TryModBoost#InstallingModularBoost

The Boost Graph Library cannot currently be built outside of Boost itself.
